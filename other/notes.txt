> 1. Consider lastInteractedAt as a heartbeat if it is later than a heartbeat
> 2. 60 seconds after the last heartbeat remove the user from the players list
> 3. 3 minutes after the last interaction consider user as inactive except for the current player
> 4. Show the a model with message that they need to keep guessing to remain in the room
> 5. 4 minutes after the last interaction kick the user out of the room except for the current player


1. Whenever a player gets nominated (even by self) as a current player they will see a screen with 3 words
2. 3 words would be selected from a corpora of common words
3. Player has to select the word within 10 seconds
4. Once they select the word in 10 seconds, the wordwill be added to current hash
5. Use simple encoding to encode the word
6. After the player selects the word. They will get 70 seconds to draw the word
7. If any player is found to be out of bound by 5 seconds during above process they will be considered inactive

> 1. Improve the toolbox at the bottom
> 2. Don't show just start drawing for non-drawable user

Following will be the flow for bord page

Initial state of the board would be "Empty" with 0 players present

1. User A will join(/reactivates)

The board will change to "Waiting". There won't be much change for the board except that there would be a message, "Waiting for players".

2. User B joins(/reactivates).

The board will change to "Active". As the state is changing to active, the first user in the players will be selected for drawing.

Once active, current player position will be set. And for current player, states will be determined.

Initially, current player state will be "Selecting".

Once the playing starts, a user will get a screen to select a word for the first 20 seconds.

At the end of which, the selected word will be set, and current current player state will be "Drawing".

For non-current players,

 - when current_player state is "Selecting", they will be shown a message, "Player is selecting the word"
 - when current_player state is "Drawing",
    they will be shown a message, "Guess the word" and
    whatever the current_player is drawing would be shown on the screen.
    they will also be able to ttype their guesses

This state will last till following conditions are met.

1. All non-current players guess the word correctly.
2. Or 60 seconds are elapsed since last state change i.e. drawing started.

Once the current_player state changes to "Complete"

The next player in the list of players will be chosen as current_player and the process will continue.

After each update from server, Housekeeping function will be called by the first active user in the playing list.

While Housekeeping for the first player's heartbeat will be perfomed by every player.
It will deactivate housekeeper if he did not send heartbeat every HEART_BEAT_INTERVAL * 2 seconds.

The Housekeeping will do following things.

Check to make sure, current player is active. If not, select next player or change board state.
If current player's state is still "Selecting" after 20 + GRACE_PERIOD seconds, change current_player.
Remove players not sending hertbeat after 60 seconds and handle if they are current player.
